## Tasks to do
Since codebase is not available

1. Get the LNN Package Running
2. Get vanilla RL running - Make it modular so we can itegrate and test easily
3. Combine them to integrate external knowledge with RL COntroller
4. Initial Test on Pacman
5. Lets try safeRL benchmarks? (https://openai.com/blog/safety-gym/)


# Deliverables

## Phase 1 - October 16

1. Modular Code - Enable easier switching of Gym environments
2. Knowledge base generation
3. Working code base
4. Show results on atleast 1 example (2 in the best case)
5. Report with structure hinting towards the final project submission
